# Defect-Detection-EL-Images

Within this project I implemented a Residual Neural Network in PyTorch and used it for classifying defects of solar cells. Solar cells can exhbit various types of degradation caused by inappropriate transportation, installation, or bad weather conditions such as wind or hail. The model implemented here, focuses on the classification of 5 different types of defects described in more detail below. A Inception -v3 from PyTorch pre-trained on the ILSVRC2012 ImageNet database is used for this task. All layers were fine-tuned to adapt to the classification of solar-cell defects.
This repository provides a dataset of solar cell images extracted from high-resolution electroluminescence images of photovoltaic modules.
